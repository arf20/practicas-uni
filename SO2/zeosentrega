4. Its executing a jmp for the while(1)

## 2.6.2.

 - Yes
 - No, because the object code does not have real addresses, only relative. The linking stage fills in the real addresses according to the linker script.
 - The `while (1) { }`
 - There is never a call to add(), main() is only a infinite loop. Because its being compiled with -O2. user.o can be generated manually with -O0 because for some reason changing the optimization level in CFLAGS breaks the compilation which shouldn't be possible.

## 2.6.3.

 - 
   - `add(int, int)` is not dynamically linked.
   - Via the stack, relative to %ebp
   - Via %eax
 - 
   - 0x113fdc
